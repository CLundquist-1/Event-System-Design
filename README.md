# Event-System-Design
This is a working test design for our Event System. It is the skeleton that I am massaging into our existing game. It is mostly compiler written for easy enough expansion (thank god for templates). It is cache friendly. The design makes assumptions about the strucuter of the data (such as assuming that the first n entries in the dynamic entities vector is the players, the next k is the AI controlled contestants, and assumptions cannot be made about the remaining). In the design you can see where I have taken the liberty of changing the way that our data is structured in a number of our core systems to make it more cache friendly (in hopes of allowing us to add more AI controlled vehicles, particile effects, and potentially expand the map)
